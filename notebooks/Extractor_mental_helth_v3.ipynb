He has been performing relatively well academically, with a CGPA between 3.00 and 3.49. The student mentioned that he is not married, which could potentially influence his social support network and the stressors he faces.\n",

He has not reported any depression or panic attacks, which can help us focus on addressing the anxiety more effectively. He also mentioned that he has not sought any professional help or treatment for these concerns in the past.\n",

I recommend referring him to a specialist, such as a clinical psychologist or counselor, who can provide appropriate support and treatment for his anxiety.
